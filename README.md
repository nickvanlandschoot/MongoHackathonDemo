Advanced threat actors target critical infrastructure and services via compromised packages in targeted supply chain attacks. Vulnerability scanners only catch attacks after weeks of exposure and compromise which is good for preventing widespread damages from automated scanners but does virtually nothing to protect the original targets. This project map's and monitors those downstream dependencies in a long running continuous process allowing AI to detect and flag potential threat signals.
